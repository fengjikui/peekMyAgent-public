# peekMyAgent

[中文 README](README.zh-CN.md) | [Full User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)

## Start Here

If you already have Claude Code working, this is the shortest path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fengjikui/peekMyAgent-public/main/install.sh | bash
peekmyagent open
cd <your-project>
peekmyagent claude -c
```

Then use Claude Code normally. Open `http://127.0.0.1:43110` or run `peekmyagent open` to inspect the captured requests.

For the complete walkthrough, read the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md).

## Overview

peekMyAgent is a local-first dashboard for inspecting what coding agents send to model providers.

It helps you understand how tools such as Claude Code and OpenClaw assemble system prompts, user messages, tool definitions, tool results, history, model parameters, and raw request bodies before they reach the remote model.

peekMyAgent is not meant to "steal hidden prompts". It is an observability tool for your own local agent sessions, in environments where you explicitly choose to record and inspect the traffic.

## What You Can Do Today

- Open a local dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:43110`.
- Start Claude Code through `peekmyagent claude ...` and capture its model requests.
- Start OpenClaw through `peekmyagent openclaw ...` and capture its model requests.
- Inspect requests as a timeline with user input, system summaries, tools, tool calls, tool results, responses, token usage, and raw JSON.
- Inspect Claude Code subagent traffic and group child-agent requests.
- Open the dashboard from inside Claude Code with `/peekmyagent`.
- Pause, resume, stop, or clear a current recording from Claude Code slash commands.
- Send a message to a watched Agent directly from the dashboard.

## Requirements

- macOS or a Unix-like shell environment.
- Node.js 18 or newer.
- Claude Code and/or OpenClaw already installed and working.
- Your model provider configuration should already work in the terminal where you run the Agent.

If `claude` does not work by itself, fix that first:

```bash
claude --version
claude -p --output-format text "Reply OK"
```

## Install From Source

Recommended one-line install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fengjikui/peekMyAgent-public/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer clones this repo to `~/.peekmyagent/app` and creates a CLI shim at `~/.local/bin/peekmyagent`. If `~/.local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, the installer prints the command you need to add.

Manual install:

Clone the repository and link the CLI:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd peekMyAgent
npm link
```

Check the command:

```bash
peekmyagent --help
```

If you do not want to use `npm link`, run the CLI from the repository:

```bash
node bin/peekmyagent.mjs --help
```

All examples below use `peekmyagent`. If you skipped `npm link`, replace it with `node /path/to/peekMyAgent/bin/peekmyagent.mjs`.

## Quick Start With Claude Code

Open the dashboard:

```bash
peekmyagent open
```

Start Claude Code through peekMyAgent:

```bash
cd <your-project>
peekmyagent claude -c
```

Then use Claude Code normally. Captured requests will appear in the dashboard.

If you intentionally want to run Claude Code with permission prompts disabled, put Claude Code's flag after `claude`:

```bash
peekmyagent claude -c --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Use this only in repositories you trust. The flag belongs to Claude Code, not peekMyAgent, and it bypasses Claude Code's normal permission checks.

To open the dashboard again later:

```bash
peekmyagent open
```

To print the dashboard URL without opening a browser:

```bash
peekmyagent open --print
```

The dashboard runs locally by default:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:43110
```

## Resume A Claude Code Session

Resume a specific Claude Code session:

```bash
peekmyagent claude -r <session-id>
```

Continue the last Claude Code session:

```bash
peekmyagent claude -c
```

When Claude Code uses `-c/--continue` or `-r/--resume`, peekMyAgent may find an existing recording for the same project/session. In an interactive terminal it asks whether to reuse that recording or create a new one.

Use these flags to choose explicitly:

```bash
peekmyagent --reuse claude -c
peekmyagent --new claude -c
peekmyagent --ask claude -r <session-id>
```

## Install Claude Code Slash Commands

Install the Claude Code skill and slash-command templates:

```bash
peekmyagent install-claude-skill --commands
```

This installs:

- `~/.claude/skills/peekmyagent-control/SKILL.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/peekmyagent.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/peekmyagent-status.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/peekmyagent-pause.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/peekmyagent-resume.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/peekmyagent-stop.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/peekmyagent-clear.md`

Inside Claude Code you can then run:

```text
/peekmyagent
/peekmyagent-status
/peekmyagent-pause
/peekmyagent-resume
/peekmyagent-stop
/peekmyagent-clear
```

Command meaning:

- `/peekmyagent`: open or print the dashboard URL.
- `/peekmyagent-status`: associate the current Claude Code session with the dashboard and print capture instructions.
- `/peekmyagent-pause`: keep forwarding requests but stop saving request bodies.
- `/peekmyagent-resume`: resume saving request bodies.
- `/peekmyagent-stop`: stop the current recording and keep existing captures.
- `/peekmyagent-clear`: stop and remove the current recording from the dashboard list.

Important: slash commands cannot retroactively change the environment of an already-running Claude Code process. For exact provider request capture, start or resume Claude Code through `peekmyagent claude ...`.

## Dashboard Layout

The dashboard has three main areas:

- Left sidebar: projects, sessions, live watches, and evidence packages.
- Center timeline: user inputs, Agent requests, assistant responses, tool calls, tool results, subagent flow, token usage, and collapsible summaries.
- Right raw panel: the original captured JSON body and normalized sections.

Useful buttons:

- `展开上行`: show the full upstream request area for one request.
- `System`: inspect system prompt blocks.
- `Tools`: inspect tool descriptions and schemas.
- `Tool calls`: inspect tool calls sent by the model.
- `Tool results`: inspect tool results returned to the model.
- `Response`: inspect captured model responses.
- `Raw`: inspect the original captured JSON.

If the source is a live Claude Code or OpenClaw watch, the bottom composer can send a message to the watched Agent:

- Press `Enter` to send.
- Press `Shift + Enter` for a new line.

## OpenClaw

Start OpenClaw through peekMyAgent:

```bash
peekmyagent openclaw agent --session-key agent:main:my-session --message "hello"
```

If no OpenClaw subcommand is passed, peekMyAgent runs:

```bash
openclaw --profile peekmyagent chat
```

OpenClaw integration uses an isolated `peekmyagent` profile instead of patching your main profile directly.

For more details, see [docs/openclaw-profile-watch.md](docs/openclaw-profile-watch.md).

## Demo Viewer

You can open built-in evidence packages without running a real Agent:

```bash
npm run view
```

Or choose a specific demo:

```bash
node bin/peekmyagent.mjs dev view --demo openclaw-subagent --open
node bin/peekmyagent.mjs dev view --demo openclaw-multiturn --open
node bin/peekmyagent.mjs dev view --demo claude-subagent --open
node bin/peekmyagent.mjs dev view --demo claude-proxy-resume --open
```

This is useful for demos, screenshots, and UI review.

## Privacy And Safety

peekMyAgent is local-first, but captured data can still be sensitive.

Captured requests may include:

- User messages.
- System prompts and developer instructions.
- Tool descriptions and tool schemas.
- Tool results.
- File paths.
- Project context.
- Model parameters.
- Raw provider request bodies.

Recommendations:

- Start with a non-sensitive project when trying the tool.
- Do not share dashboard screenshots that include private code, secrets, or proprietary prompts.
- Do not expose the local dashboard to the public internet.
- Use `/peekmyagent-pause` before entering sensitive content.
- Use `/peekmyagent-clear` when a recording should be removed from the local dashboard list.

## Troubleshooting

### `peekmyagent` command not found

Run the installer again:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fengjikui/peekMyAgent-public/main/install.sh | bash
```

If the installer says `~/.local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, add this to your shell profile and restart the terminal:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

You can also use the direct path:

```bash
node ~/.peekmyagent/app/bin/peekmyagent.mjs open
```

### Port 43110 is already in use

Try restarting the daemon:

```bash
peekmyagent restart --print --no-open --force
```

Or shut it down:

```bash
peekmyagent shutdown --force
```

### Claude Code says the selected model cannot be used

First verify Claude Code without peekMyAgent:

```bash
claude -p --output-format text "Reply OK"
```

If this fails, fix the provider/model configuration first.

If it works in your shell but fails from the dashboard composer, restart peekMyAgent from the same shell environment:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
peekmyagent restart --print --no-open --force
```

Then start Claude Code through the wrapper again:

```bash
peekmyagent claude -c
```

### Slash commands show a session but no new requests are captured

This usually means Claude Code was already running before peekMyAgent configured the provider base URL.

For exact capture, exit Claude Code and restart through peekMyAgent:

```bash
peekmyagent claude -r <session-id>
```

### Subagent requests look different from normal requests

Claude Code subagents can create child-agent requests with their own internal identifiers. peekMyAgent uses available request headers and trace hints to group those requests, but provider/model compatibility can still affect whether subagent calls succeed.

## Development Checks

Useful smoke tests:

```bash
npm run smoke:cli
npm run smoke:dashboard-open
npm run smoke:agent-send
npm run smoke:daemon-claude
npm run smoke:run-claude
npm run smoke:agent-trace-view
npm run smoke:timeline-display
npm run smoke:openclaw-subagent
npm run smoke:openclaw-multiturn
```

Run a syntax check on the dashboard client:

```bash
node --check src/viewer/client.js
```
